		<h1>Términos del servicio</h1>

<p>The following Terms of Service ("Terms”) govern your access to and use of the loowid.com service and website (the "Service"), and any video, sound, text, graphics, or other materials sent, received, stored or otherwise appearing in the Service (collectively referred to as "Content").
</p>
<h1>Basic description of the service</h1>

<p>Loowid.com is a web application that provides a way to perform video conversations (audio and video streaming) with other people using web browsers. To access to this service, a person must create a room and after send or share the unique URL provided by the service to join to the conversation. The method to send the URL must be done out of the loowid.com. It could be done sharing by email, twitter, facebook, etc. Each person that opens the URL in the browser will enter to the room and see and listen everything that is being streamed in the room. Nobody has to register or install nothing in your computer, just access to the URL with the browser.
</p>
<p>			
The sound a video (webcam or desktop) is only seen by people that access to the room in the time that content is published. You can see people connected in the list but maybe are using an alias.
</p>
<p>
By default the access to the room is open. It means that anybody that knows the URL can open it to the browser. Room owner (the one who created it) can change the access policy and make enter a password required to access to the room. This password must be distributed by room owner out of the webapp using an alternative media like the ones described before.
</p>

<p>
Owner also has the chance of blocking the room if he doesn’t want to allow more people join, so it would preserve the connections of people that already joined. In any moment during the conversation the owner can kick out any of the spectators (guests users). When it happens the kicked out user won’t be able to see the streams of this room anymore. At this point the URL is invalidated and a new one is generated in order to send it to other users to join in the room. It means that the kicked out users won’t be able to access again unless it knows the new URL. The rest of users that were in the room will remain in it.
</p>

<p>
Once the room owner abandons the room it won’t be able to use it again. The URL of this room won’t be useful anymore.
</p>

<p>		
Each room is provided with a chat. Any member of the room will be able to see any chat message of the chat even if the access after the chat message was written by other member. By default the chat incoming messages are reproduced by your computer speakers if you are not viewing the room window or closed the chat panel. You can’t turn it off pressing the chat’s mute option”.
</p>
<p>	
Room owners can send and receive files from/to spectators.
</p>
			
<p>
By default the room is not moderated and any spectator can initiate a video or audio stream to all the room members or send a file to owner. This behaviour can be restricted by the owner turning the moderation option on. That will cause that nobody can share nothing unless the owner asks for sharing an specific resource (audio, cam, desktop).
